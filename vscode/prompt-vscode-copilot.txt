Basic ask
*****************
Ok, I bite. 

Expand on the "basic usage notes for using github copilot in vscode". Assume I have already installed it and used it a little bit. See if you can add otheir feature called "add context". Also provide some details around

1. what I can do with it in the file that I have open?

2. how can I advise or ask copilot to prepare a folder that I have hightlighted, say for turning that into a python module (assuming it is an empty folder) at this point. can it create hence new files in that folder?

3. Expand on its comment capabilities

4. Also provide key references from their homepage, key blogs, or any useful videos. Especially around add context and its capabilities to look around the whole repo for its analysis.
