# Overview

<!-- ********************* -->

Cascade layers let you group CSS rules into **named buckets** and decide **which bucket wins** before specificity is considered. Layers prevent “specificity wars” by establishing predictable precedence for broad categories like resets, base styles, components, and utilities.

<!-- ********************* -->

# Why layers aren’t everywhere (yet)

<!-- ********************* -->

Despite strong browser support since around 2022, many codebases don’t visibly use `@layer` yet. Common reasons:

* **Feature recency and legacy code**: Large apps and enterprises predate layers and move slowly; older browsers (e.g., IE) never supported them.
* **Tooling hides them**: Frameworks already manage order without you writing `@layer`.

  * **Tailwind**: ships `base`, `components`, `utilities` internally via `@tailwind …`; developers seldom type `@layer` directly.
  * **CSS Modules**: local class scoping + import order reduce global conflicts.
  * **CSS‑in‑JS** (styled‑components/emotion): runtime injection order controls precedence.
* **Established patterns work “well enough”**: BEM, utility classes, and import order conventions minimize specificity fights; teams stick with familiar approaches.
* **Mixed layered/unlayered surprises**: Unlayered author CSS outranks layered CSS of the same importance, so partial adoption can confuse teams until everything is layered consistently.
* **Third‑party styles aren’t layered**: Vendor CSS rarely ships with `@layer`. To integrate cleanly, you must import it into a dedicated layer.

**Pragmatic adoption tips**

* Declare a project order once, then place rules accordingly:

  ```css
  @layer vendor, reset, base, components, utilities;
  @import url("vendor.css") layer(vendor);
  @layer reset { /* normalize/reset */ }
  @layer base { /* tokens, element defaults (use :where()) */ }
  @layer components { /* reusable components */ }
  @layer utilities { /* one‑off helpers that should win */ }
  ```
* Keep early layers **low specificity** (prefer `:where(...)`) so components/utilities can override easily.
* Avoid IDs in early layers; layer order already gives you control.

# The cascade with layers (the new order of operations)

<!-- ********************* -->

When multiple rules match the same element, the browser resolves conflicts using this order (within a single origin, e.g., author styles):

1. Importance (`!important`)
2. **Layer order** (later layers beat earlier layers)
3. Specificity
4. Source order (later in the file wins on ties)

Layers sit **between** importance and specificity, so a class in a later layer can beat an ID in an earlier layer.

<!-- ********************* -->

# Declaring and ordering layers

<!-- ********************* -->

Define the global order once, left‑to‑right from lowest to highest priority:

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities; /* order definition */
```

You can also declare a single layer ad‑hoc:

```css
@layer components { /* component styles here */ }
```

The first form (with a comma list) is preferred for teams—everyone sees the intended stack at a glance.

<!-- ********************* -->

# Adding rules to layers (including across files)

<!-- ********************* -->

Open a layer anywhere, as many times as you like; rules are merged into that layer:

```css
@layer reset {
  *, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }
}

@layer base {
  :where(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,p) { margin: 0; }
}

@layer components {
  .card { padding: 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; }
}

@layer utilities {
  .text-blue { color: #2563eb; }
}
```

Bring external files directly into a layer:

```css
@import url("typography.css") layer(base);
@import url("buttons.css") layer(components);
```

If you omit a layer name when importing, the file’s rules are **unlayered** (see below).

<!-- ********************* -->

# How layers interact with specificity, `!important`, and source order

<!-- ********************* -->

* **Layers vs. specificity**: Layer order is evaluated **before** specificity. A simple class in `utilities` can override a more specific selector in `base`.
* **Within the same layer**: normal rules apply—specificity decides, then source order breaks ties.
* **`!important`**: Importance is evaluated **before** layer order. Among `!important` rules, layer order then applies.

Example:

```css
@layer base { #promo { color: red; } }        /* ID specificity, lower layer */
@layer utilities { .text-blue { color: blue; } } /* class, higher layer → wins */
```

<!-- ********************* -->

# Unlayered CSS vs. layered CSS

<!-- ********************* -->

Rules **not** inside any `@layer` behave as if they are in an **implicit top layer** for that origin. In practice, unlayered author rules will **beat** layered author rules of the same importance. To make everything predictable, place your project CSS in named layers and reserve unlayered rules for deliberate overrides.

<!-- ********************* -->

# Common usage patterns

<!-- ********************* -->

**Reset → Base → Components → Utilities**

```css
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

@layer reset      { /* UA neutralization / normalize */ }
@layer base       { /* typography tokens, element defaults */ }
@layer components { /* reusable components */ }
@layer utilities  { /* one-off helpers (.mt-4, .text-blue) */ }
```

**Structure kept light with `:where()`** (zero specificity), intent at the edge:

```css
@layer base {
  :where(article, aside) :where(h1, h2, h3) { margin-block: .5rem; }
}
@layer components {
  .title { margin-block: 1rem; } /* easily overrides base */
}
```

**Utilities that reliably win without `!important`:**

```css
@layer utilities { .hidden { display: none; } .text-center { text-align: center; } }
```

**Third‑party CSS**: Import vendor styles into a dedicated layer so you can override them cleanly:

```css
@layer vendor, app-base, app-components, app-utilities;
@import url("vendor-lib.css") layer(vendor);
```

<!-- ********************* -->

# Worked examples

<!-- ********************* -->

**Layer beats specificity**

```css
@layer base { #banner .cta { color: red; } }
@layer utilities { .text-blue { color: blue; } }
<!-- <a id="banner" class="text-blue cta">…</a> → blue wins (utilities layer) -->
```

**Within the same layer, specificity rules**

```css
@layer components {
  .btn { background: #eee; }
  .btn.primary { background: #0ea5e9; } /* more specific → wins */
}
```

**Source order breaks ties inside a layer**

```css
@layer components {
  .card { padding: 12px; }
  .card { padding: 16px; } /* same specificity, later wins */
}
```

**Unlayered author CSS beats layered**

```css
@layer base { .prose p { line-height: 1.5; } }
.prose p { line-height: 1.7; } /* unlayered → takes precedence */
```

<!-- ********************* -->

# Debugging tips

<!-- ********************* -->

* **Define order once** at the top: `@layer reset, base, components, utilities;`
* **Name layers clearly** so intent is obvious in DevTools.
* In **browser DevTools**, check the “Matched CSS” panel—most show layer names next to rules.
* Keep lower layers low‑specificity (use `:where()`), avoid IDs in early layers.
* Prefer utilities in a final layer over scattering `!important`.
