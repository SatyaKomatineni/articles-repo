## What is Wrangler?

Wrangler is Cloudflareâ€™s official command-line tool (CLI) for managing and deploying Cloudflare Workers. It simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of serverless applications on Cloudflare's edge network.

### **Why Use Wrangler?**
- **Easy Project Management**: Initializes, configures, and manages Worker projects.
- **Local Development**: Provides a local development server to test Workers before deployment.
- **Seamless Deployment**: Publishes your Workers with a single command.
- **Integration with Cloudflare Services**: Works with KV storage, Durable Objects, and Cloudflare Pages.

Wrangler makes it easy to interact with Cloudflare Workers, eliminating the need to manually configure API requests or interact with the Cloudflare dashboard for deployment.

For more details, visit the [Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/).

## Install Wrangler CLI

Wrangler is Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers.

1. **Install via npm**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     npm install -g wrangler
     ```
   - This command installs Wrangler globally on your system.

Alternative:
```sh
cargo install wrangler
```

## Authenticate Wrangler

Before deploying Workers, authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account.

1. **Log In**:
   - In your terminal, execute:
     ```sh
     wrangler login
     ```
   - This command will open your default web browser, prompting you to log in to your Cloudflare account and grant Wrangler the necessary permissions.

## Create a New Worker Project

Set up a new Worker project using Cloudflare's project generator.

1. **Initialize the Project**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     npm create cloudflare@latest my-first-worker
     ```
   - Replace `my-first-worker` with your desired project name.
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Move into your project folder:
     ```sh
     cd my-first-worker
     ```

## Write Your Worker Code

Modify the default Worker script to customize its functionality.

1. **Open the Worker Script**:
   - Locate and open `src/index.js` in your preferred code editor.
2. **Edit the Script**:
   - Replace the existing code with a simple "Hello World" response:
     ```javascript
     export default {
       async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
         return new Response("Hello from Cloudflare Workers!", {
           headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" },
         });
       },
     };
     ```

---

## Preview Your Worker Locally

Test your Worker locally before deploying it.

1. **Run the local preview**:
   ```sh
   wrangler dev
   ```
2. **Test the Worker**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8787/`.
   - You should see "Hello from Cloudflare Workers!".

---

## Deploy Your Worker

Deploy your Worker to Cloudflare's edge network.

1. **Run the following command**:
   ```sh
   wrangler publish
   ```
2. **Get the deployment URL**:
   - After deployment, Wrangler will provide a URL like:
     ```
     https://my-first-worker.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
     ```

---

## Test Your Deployed Worker

1. **Visit the deployed URL** in your browser.
2. **Use curl to check the response**:
   ```sh
   curl https://my-first-worker.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
   ```
3. **If you see the text "Hello from Cloudflare Workers!", your deployment is successful!** ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

- Explore **Workers KV** for key-value storage.
- Integrate **Durable Objects** for stateful applications.
- Deploy full-stack apps with **Cloudflare Pages + Workers**.
- Check Cloudflare's [official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) for advanced use cases.
