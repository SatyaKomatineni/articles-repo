8. Provide references with an explanation of each reference in a few lines.
9. Use my global project level instructions while creating the md file.
10. Also consider, given this context, what additional questions I should be asking and include them in the article.
11. When opening a new section that has subsections introduce the section in a line or two or a parapgraph.
12. For bullets prefer numbering them
13. For sections like challenges, guidelines, and design considerations, explain the sub elements with a few lines (not lengthy, and yet not too brief)
14. Make the total article length, a longer article.
15. Name the article: Vector reuse ver 2
