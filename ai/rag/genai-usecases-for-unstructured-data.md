<!-- ********************* -->
# üìÑ Summarization
<!-- ********************* -->

Summarization applications are designed to condense long or complex content into shorter, more digestible forms while retaining key information.

- Document summaries (single or multi-document)
- Meeting and call transcript condensation
- Legal, medical, or scientific abstracts
- Email or chat thread summarization

<!-- ********************* -->
# ‚ùì Question Answering
<!-- ********************* -->

This category involves directly answering user questions based on content found in unstructured text, often with or without retrieval.

- RAG-based document Q&A
- Domain-specific knowledge assistants
- Closed-book LLM question answering

<!-- ********************* -->
# üîç Semantic Search & Retrieval
<!-- ********************* -->

These applications aim to find relevant content from a large corpus based on semantic similarity or contextual understanding rather than keyword matching.

- Semantic or hybrid search over corpora
- Long-document retrieval (e.g., PDFs, contracts)
- Cross-lingual or context-aware document retrieval

<!-- ********************* -->
# üìã Information Extraction
<!-- ********************* -->

This use case focuses on turning unstructured text into structured information, enabling downstream automation or analytics.

- Structured data from text (e.g., extracting fields from resumes, contracts, forms)
- Named entity recognition (NER)
- Key-value pair or fact extraction from unstructured sources

<!-- ********************* -->
# üìä Classification & Labeling (on Text)
<!-- ********************* -->

Classification and labeling involve applying tags, categories, or labels to unstructured text based on its content or intent.

- Document or paragraph classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic modeling
- Risk or content flagging from documents or chats

<!-- ********************* -->
# üß† Reasoning & Interpretation on Unstructured Inputs
<!-- ********************* -->

These applications push beyond extraction into higher-order thinking‚Äîdrawing conclusions, analyzing implications, or performing decision support.

- Chain-of-thought reasoning over document content
- Legal, academic, or policy document interpretation
- Multi-step decision making based on narrative input

<!-- ********************* -->
# üí¨ Conversational Interfaces on Textual Data
<!-- ********************* -->

These systems allow users to interact with unstructured documents in a conversational format, often blending chat UX with retrieval and summarization.

- Document chatbots (‚Äúchat with your docs‚Äù)
- FAQ generation from knowledge bases
- Interactive summarization or retrieval over documents

<!-- ********************* -->
# üîÑ Transformation of Text
<!-- ********************* -->

These tasks focus on modifying existing text for clarity, tone, structure, or language‚Äîwithout changing the underlying meaning.

- Translation and localization
- Rewriting (style, tone, clarity)
- Simplification or formalization
- Grammar and fluency correction

<!-- ********************* -->
# üìë Comparison and Change Detection
<!-- ********************* -->

This application class helps identify and explain differences between two versions of a document or related unstructured sources.

- Document redline and revision comparison
- Contract version analysis
- Highlighting key differences between similar documents
- Policy drift or compliance shift detection

# Summary Table
<!-- ********************* -->

| #  | Application Class                          | Description                                                                 | Is Vectorization Useful?         |
|----|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1  | Summarization                              | Producing concise, informative digests from long or complex documents       | Not typically                     |
| 2  | Question Answering                         | Providing direct answers using document context, often using retrieval      | Often helpful (especially in RAG) |
| 3  | Semantic Search & Retrieval                | Locating relevant or related content using meaning-aware techniques         | Yes                               |
| 4  | Information Extraction                     | Identifying and structuring specific facts or fields from raw text          | Rarely (symbolic or rule-based better) |
| 5  | Classification & Labeling (on Text)        | Categorizing or annotating documents based on content or sentiment          | Sometimes (embedding helps generalization) |
| 6  | Reasoning & Interpretation on Text         | Applying logic or analysis to textual input for deeper understanding        | Not primary, LLM reasoning preferred |
| 7  | Conversational Interfaces on Textual Data  | Interactive, natural-language access to document knowledge                  | Useful when combined with retrieval |
| 8  | Transformation of Text                     | Changing tone, structure, language, or clarity of existing text              | No                                |
| 9  | Comparison and Change Detection            | Spotting meaningful differences across versions or related documents         | No (rule/pattern-based preferred) |
