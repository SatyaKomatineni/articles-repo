# Introduction
<!-- ********************* -->

Vector embeddings are a cornerstone of modern GenAI workflows, especially for semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, they are often **overused or misapplied** in applications where simpler or more targeted techniques would perform better.

This article explores when **not** to use vector embeddings, what to consider before reaching for them, and better alternatives for common tasks.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Common Misuses of Vector Embeddings
<!-- ********************* -->

Vector search is frequently over-applied in cases such as:

- **Structured data extraction**: e.g., extracting invoice fields or contract details, where schema-aware extraction or prompting works better.
- **Text summarization**: Summarizing a single document doesnâ€™t usually require vector search unless used in multi-doc contexts.
- **Text-to-SQL**: Translating natural language into queries typically benefits more from prompt engineering and schema-awareness than similarity retrieval.
- **Small corpora**: When the number of documents is limited, direct prompting or full-document ingestion by the LLM may be more efficient.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Signs You're Overusing Vectors
<!-- ********************* -->

1. You're retrieving chunks for every prompt regardless of context.
2. Your document set is static and small, but you still maintain a vector index.
3. You're treating vector search as a substitute for parsing, extraction, or reasoning.
4. Your retrieved chunks frequently include irrelevant or low-signal content.

# What to Use Instead
<!-- ********************* -->

| Task Type                     | Better Alternative                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Structured Data Extraction   | Prompt templates, schema-aware models              |
| Text Summarization           | Direct LLM summarization via prompt or tool usage  |
| Text-to-SQL                  | Guided prompting, function calling, structured parsers |
| QA on Small Document Sets    | Full-document ingestion or direct context prompts  |
| Document Classification      | Zero/few-shot classification with LLMs             |

<!-- ********************* -->
# Additional Caution Areas
<!-- ********************* -->

Beyond the obvious cases, here are other categories where vector use should be reconsidered:

### 1. Deterministic Lookups or Entity Resolution
- Use cases like product catalog matching, name disambiguation, or ID resolution require precision.
- Vector similarity is fuzzy and may return near-matches that are incorrect.
- âœ… Use: rule-based matching, fuzzy string search (e.g., `RapidFuzz`, `trie` structures).

### 2. Form-Filling and Compliance Tasks
- Use cases that involve pulling structured data from contracts or invoices.
- These demand strict field mapping â€” not semantic guesswork.
- âœ… Use: Template-based extraction, few-shot prompts, function calling.

### 3. Multi-Step Reasoning or Chain-of-Thought Workflows
- When tasks involve sequential logic or decision chains, retrieval may add confusion.
- âœ… Use: Structured prompting, agents, or scratchpad-style workflows.

### 4. Tight Context Tasks (e.g., full-doc summarization)
- Splitting context into chunks can degrade comprehension.
- âœ… Use: Hierarchical summarization, long-context models, sliding windows.

### 5. High-Explainability Applications
- Regulated domains (healthcare, finance) may need auditable output.
- Vector matching lacks transparency.
- âœ… Use: Rule-based systems or symbolic search.

### 6. Document Classification
- Embeddings may group topically similar but label-irrelevant docs.
- âœ… Use: LLM-based zero-shot classification or fine-tuned classifiers.

### Tip:
> Vectors â‰  memory. Donâ€™t use vector search to track intermediate reasoning steps or internal state.

# Summary
<!-- ********************* -->

While vector embeddings are a powerful tool, they are **not universally applicable**. Many GenAI applications overuse them in places where prompt engineering, schema-aware tools, or full-document LLM input would be simpler and more effective.

âœ… Use vectors when:
- Your task involves ambiguity or fuzzy matching.
- Your corpus is large, diverse, or semi-structured.

ðŸš« Consider alternatives when:
- Your task requires structured reasoning, deterministic output, or simple extraction.
- Your data set is small, known, or static.

Be intentional about tool choice to reduce complexity, avoid hallucinations, and improve overall GenAI effectiveness.
