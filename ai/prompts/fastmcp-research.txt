Hello, can you do this for me

Can you write an article about FastMCP based on the readme file URL that is at

https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md#open-developer-guide


You should

1. Explain what is Fastmcp.
2. its capabilities.
3. List of topics covered at this URL.
4. Further references with an explanation of each reference.
5. Create me an md file based on my previous global project instructions on how to structure the md file.
