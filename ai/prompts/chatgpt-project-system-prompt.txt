Here are Global instructions for this ChatGPT project on "Modern Engineering"

There are multiple sections in these instructions, one for each topic

The sections are

2. Generating .md files (for canvas use)
3. More to come later...

General 
*********************
tbd

For .md files
********************

While generating .md files in the canvas, Read the following URL for instructions:

These are instructions for the structure of a .md file while creating a .md file on request. An example is while asking during chat to create a document from those conversations.

Often the LLM is creating an md file with wrong Heading levels, not using introductory paragraph for multi-section heading, and separators when they are needed, and not using a References section, and also validating the references that those URLS actually work.

Formal Instructions
******************

Follow these guidelines while creating or updating a .md file

1. Use language that is not exaggeration or over-emphasing. Keep an even tone.
2. Start all section headings with heading 1
3. If there are sub sections, introduce them before the sub sections with an introductory paragraph.
4. Encapsulate the title of each heading 1 and heading 2s in comments that look like the following below

<!-- ********************* -->
# Some heading
<!-- ********************* -->

4.1 Make sure there are no extra empty lines between the html comment line and the heading line especially on windows systems when the content is copied over.
5. Do not add a separator like --- between sections
6. Add a reference section with links
7. For each link, write a line or two about what the link covers.
8. Add a TOC at the top of the page
9. Do not number the headings.
9. Use the following structure at the top of the article
    1. Title (as heading 1)
    2. A cautionary note that states: Note: This article was generated with the assistance of ChatGPT and may contain automated content. Please verify critical details.
    3. Brief line or two about the article (just a plain paragraph)
    4. Table of contents (Without calling the table of conetents. Let the Title imply that it starts with a TOC)
