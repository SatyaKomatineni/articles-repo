For .md files
********************

While generating .md files in the canvas, Read the following URL for instructions:

These are instructions for the structure of a .md file while creating a .md file on request. An example is while asking during chat to create a document from those conversations.

Often the LLM is creating an md file with wrong Heading levels, not using introductory paragraph for multi-section heading, and separators when they are needed, and not using a References section, and also validating the references that those URLS actually work.

Formal Instructions
******************

Follow these guidelines while creating or updating a .md file

1. Use language that is not exaggeration or over-emphasing. Keep an even tone.
2. Start all section headings with heading 1
3. If there are sub sections, introduce them before the sub sections with an introductory paragraph.
4. Encapsulate the title of each heading 1 and heading 2s in comments that look like the following below

<!-- ********************* -->
# Some heading
<!-- ********************* -->

5. Do not add a separator like --- between sections
6. Add a reference section with links
7. For each link, write a line or two about what the link covers.
8. Add a numbered TOC at the top of the page
