This article explores the relationships and boundaries between LLM chats, agents, and tools, addressing a series of practical design and architectural questions. These questions were asked interactively and are restated here to frame the discussion:

* How do LLM chats and agents interact or not interact?
* How are chats used as interfaces to agentic systems?
* How are agents exposed to the chat host?
* Can these agents run out of process? How do you share the context of the conversation with sub-agents?
* How do today’s chat systems normally share context? Does Google A2A solve this formally?
* Do chats assume that (MCP) tools are stateless?
* When an agent is implemented as a tool and expects state, do you pass the chat history in every call or build a protocol on top?
* How do ChatGPT or Claude integrate with MCP tools? Do they pass history or summary to the tool?

# LLM Chats vs Agents: What’s the Difference?
<!-- ********************* -->

When folks say LLM chats **can** use Agents, what does that mean? Agents have their own behavior. Do chats share state? or is it always stateless, for now in chats like ChatGPT or Claude?

To understand or explore that, first see how the industry has seen Chats and Agents so far.

## Chats

LLM chats are typically designed as user-facing, open-ended conversation interfaces. They rely on real-time user prompts to generate answers but are stateless by default. 

Chats lack autonomy

1. Doesn’t have memory or multi-step planning (unless added manually).
2. Doesn’t use tools unless explicitly prompted.
3. Doesn't "act" without user direction.
4. They lack role specialization like a planner, executor, researcher etc.
5. Chats don't enforce work flows, they are free form

## Agents
In contrast, agents are goal-oriented orchestrators. They can reason, use tools, plan multiple steps, and persist memory between calls. Agents often embed LLMs for natural language understanding but maintain structure and autonomy.

Agents typically:

1. Define roles (planner, executor, retriever).
2. Manage tools (APIs, databases, file systems).
3. Maintain persistent memory or context beyond a single prompt.
4. Operate semi-autonomously or fully autonomously.
5. Can plan and execute sequences without continuous human input.

**Example:**

A user asks an LLM, “Can you summarize this article?”

→ The LLM in chat just responds.

→ An agent might:

1. Detect the task.
2. Retrieve the article from a URL.
3. Use a summarization tool.
4. Save the result to a notes database.

## Summary table

| Feature                   | LLM Chat                          | Agent                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Role                      | User-driven conversation          | Goal-driven orchestrator               |
| Autonomy                  | None or user-triggered            | Semi- or fully-autonomous              |
| Tool use                  | Manual or limited                 | Integrated, dynamic                    |
| Memory                    | Temporary or shallow              | Persistent, often structured           |
| Multi-step planning       | Rare (unless explicitly prompted) | Core feature (with optional recursion) |
| Multi-agent collaboration | No                                | Yes                                    |

# Chats as Interfaces to Agent Systems
<!-- ********************* -->

Chat interfaces often serve as thin front-ends to complex agent systems. The user sees a conversational UI, but the backend may involve planners, retrievers, and executors.

For example, when a user asks for a draft email in Microsoft Copilot, the chat window triggers agents that fetch content, summarize past communications, and generate a reply—all behind the scenes. This separation allows user-friendly interaction on top of structured orchestration.

# How Agents Are Exposed to the Chat Host

<!-- ********************* -->

Agents are made accessible to chat hosts through a few common mechanisms:

* **Function/tool schema calls** (e.g., OpenAI function calling)
* **Router/planner dispatchers** (e.g., LangChain RouterChain)
* **Middleware orchestrators** (e.g., Autogen or CrewAI)
* **HTTP API calls** to external agent services
* **Prompt-level embeddings** (e.g., ReAct-style agents embedded in LLM context)

Each of these mechanisms determines how agents receive inputs and return outputs, and whether they support concurrent sessions or tool composition.

---

<!-- ********************* -->

# Running Agents Out-of-Process and Sharing Context

<!-- ********************* -->

Agents often run as microservices or serverless functions. This architecture is scalable but requires explicit context sharing.

Common patterns for sharing context:

* Passing conversation history or summary on every call
* Storing shared memory in Redis or a vector store
* Middleware that injects memory into the agent's prompt
* Using session IDs to track and retrieve task-specific state

---

<!-- ********************* -->

# How Most Chat Systems Handle Context

<!-- ********************* -->

In most LLM chat systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard), context is manually passed into each LLM prompt:

* A limited window of previous chat turns is included.
* Summaries are generated for older turns.
* Function calls receive context only if explicitly passed.

There is no persistent session memory inside the model unless simulated.

---

<!-- ********************* -->

# Google A2A and Formal Context Management

<!-- ********************* -->

Google’s Agents-to-Agents (A2A) framework formally addresses context as a first-class object. Agents operate with shared structured context:

* The execution environment manages the context state.
* Each agent appends or reads from this context.
* Context is versioned, observable, and isolated.

This enables modular agent orchestration with clean memory separation.

---

<!-- ********************* -->

# Are Tools Assumed to Be Stateless?

<!-- ********************* -->

Yes. In OpenAI, Claude, and LangChain, tools are assumed to be stateless. Each invocation is a pure function with no memory of prior calls.

If a tool requires state:

* It must receive context or tokens explicitly.
* Or it should be promoted to a stateful agent.

---

<!-- ********************* -->

# Stateful Tools: Pass History vs Build Protocol?

<!-- ********************* -->

When an agent is implemented as a tool but requires state, two main approaches exist:

1. **Pass chat history or summary** in each call (easy, compatible with function-calling APIs)
2. **Create a protocol** with methods like `start_session`, `set_context`, `execute`, `end_session` (scalable, modular, formal)

The second approach is more robust and aligns with how frameworks like Autogen or A2A manage sessions.

---

<!-- ********************* -->

# ChatGPT and Claude with MCP Tools

<!-- ********************* -->

Neither ChatGPT nor Claude have native support for MCP (Model Context Protocol), but they can interface with MCP-compliant tools by:

* Calling MCP tools via function-calling or APIs
* Passing summaries or task context manually
* Using session tokens or calling MCP context managers

The orchestration logic (summarizing, injecting, routing) must be handled by the developer.
