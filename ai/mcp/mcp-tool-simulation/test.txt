Fursther Tests

Here are a few more questions for thorough testing.

## Tool-Matching Questions
<!-- ********************* -->

These questions are expected to match the predefined tools directly.

### Matches `get_weather`

* What’s the weather in Tokyo today?
* Is it raining in New York?
* What’s the humidity like in Cairo?

### Matches `define_term`

* What does “resilience” mean?
* Define the term “entropy.”
* What is the meaning of “mollify”?

### Matches `convert_units`

* Convert 100 kilometers to miles.
* What is 32°F in Celsius?
* How many liters are in a gallon?

### Matches `summarize_text`

* Summarize this: “Climate change is accelerating due to greenhouse gas emissions...”
* Can you give me a short summary of this paragraph?
* Please condense this article into three sentences.

### Matches `get_stock_price`

* What is the current stock price of Google?
* Give me Apple’s market price now.
* How is TSLA performing today?

<!-- ********************* -->
## Fallback-to-General-Knowledge Questions
<!-- ********************* -->

These are not covered by the defined tools and should trigger general model reasoning.

### General Knowledge

* What is the capital of Finland?
* Who was the first person on the Moon?
* How many continents are there?

### Translation Requests

* How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
* Translate “good night” to Spanish.

<!-- ********************* -->
## Edge Cases & Ambiguity Tests
<!-- ********************* -->
These test the LLM’s reasoning to pick the best-fitting tool, or fail gracefully.
### Partial Overlap

* Tell me the temperature difference between Paris and Berlin. *(Should call `get_weather` twice?)*
* What is the meaning and origin of “serendipity”? *(Meaning matches, origin does not)*

### Multiple Matching Tools

* Give me the weather and summarize this report. *(Tests multitool parsing)*
* Define “calor” and translate it to English. *(Only one part matches a tool)*
