Goal:
I want to test how an  LLM chat can negotiate with a set of "MCP Tools" without actually having an MCP server.

Approach:

Provide a set of tools in a prompt like

toolname: tool1
    Description: tool1 Description
    argument 1: some argument
    output: Some output

Ask 1: Provide 5 such sample tools

System Prompt:

What shoould I tell the LLM when a question comes how it should give "preference to the Tools" to answer that question first, 

and if no answer found use the general knowledge but indicate in the answer what method is used to pick the answer.

Ask 2: Give that system prompt

Sample questions:

Ask 3: Give me a few sample questions to test this hypothesis.
