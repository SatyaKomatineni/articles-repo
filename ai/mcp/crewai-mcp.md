# Introduction
<!-- ********************* -->
CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating multi-agent systems, enabling teams of AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks. With increasing demand for robust and scalable AI deployments, integration options with protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) have become essential for production-grade use cases.

<!-- ********************* -->
# What is CrewAI?
<!-- ********************* -->
CrewAI is a Python-based agentic framework designed to coordinate specialized agents with distinct roles, memory, and tools. These agents can be arranged into a crew to accomplish tasks collaboratively, often using tools like LangChain, OpenAI function calling, or other APIs.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)
<!-- ********************* -->
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification and toolchain designed to manage the lifecycle, context, and execution of AI models and agents. MCP enables scalable deployments, logging, and monitoring of tasks performed by AI models in production environments.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Integration of CrewAI with MCP
<!-- ********************* -->
CrewAI can be integrated with MCP to manage the lifecycle of crews, handle deployment, orchestrate task execution, and monitor outcomes. This makes it possible to treat a CrewAI workflow as a deployable and callable resource in an MCP-compliant system.

Integration typically includes:
- Deploying crews as MCP services
- Triggering agent workflows from external clients
- Monitoring agent actions and results in real-time

<!-- ********************* -->
# Tools and Libraries for Integration
<!-- ********************* -->
The following resources are available to assist with integration:

- **[CrewAI MCP Adapter](https://mcp.so/client/crewai_mcp_adapter)**: A Python library that enables MCP-compatible communication and tooling inside CrewAI workflows.
- **[enterprise-mcp-server](https://github.com/crewAIInc/enterprise-mcp-server)**: A GitHub project that offers a server implementation for deploying and managing CrewAI crews under MCP.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Example MCP Server for CrewAI
<!-- ********************* -->
The `enterprise-mcp-server` GitHub repo provides a concrete implementation of an MCP server that works with CrewAI. This server allows users to:

- Define and register CrewAI agents and crews
- Trigger crew execution via RESTful endpoints
- Track execution metadata and outcomes

It is useful for organizations looking to wrap CrewAI inside an API-accessible, monitored system.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Use Cases
<!-- ********************* -->
Some scenarios where CrewAI-MCP integration proves valuable include:
- **Customer Service Automation**: Orchestrating multiple agents handling FAQs, escalations, and summaries
- **Financial Analysis Pipelines**: Agents collaborating on stock analysis, plotting, and reporting
- **Content Generation Systems**: Coordinating research, writing, and editing agents to produce media content
- **Operations Monitoring**: AI agents monitoring logs, metrics, and generating alerts or responses
