# Reimagining Enterprise AI Applications with MCPs to Drive Simplicity and Adoption in Enterprises
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

This article explores how Model Context Protocols (MCPs), when combined with general‑purpose UX platforms (like ChatGPT, Claude, CoPilot, Cursor, Slack, MS Teams) simplify the deployment of AI in enterprises.&#x20;

The practice is to shift from vertical interfaces and tool‑specific integrations toward satisfying a party of unified UX layers, where enterprises need only focus on building (Federated) MCP‑compliant servers while leveraging shared agentic user experiences.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## Approach to closing the Enterprise AI Vavlue Gap 
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Currently, engineering of AI adoption in Enterprises is slow. There is an opportunity to correct this.

Number of unobvious factors are contributing factors.

Enterprise developers are in the traditional paradigm of **writing vertical applications** by inserting LLM calls where needed. In this model, each application or capability requires a separate UX, authentication model, and deployment flow.

Vertical applications mean too many "concerns" to develop in one tool. The UX, the APIs, unstructured data, vectorization, security, devops etc. **Vertical UX is a bottleneck** for a number of reasons, one of which is the deep expertise needed in numerous libraries needed for React and like.

So, a fact: Vertical applications punch above their worth when it comes to cost and time.

**Insight:** Vertical applications, (discounting platforms like Salesforce, MS Dynamics, etc), are needed in the non-ai space! They are not ESSENTIAL for the AI world, where applications are conversational, nimble, and ever transforming!

Model Context Protocols (MCPs), such as the open standard proposed by Anthropic and adopted by OpenAI and DeepMind, offer a way to expose enterprise assets (APIs, data) to AI capabilities independently of how they are used. Meanwhile, a horizontal UX model—one that works across all MCP servers—could become "the commuter aviation standard" for enterprise AI: Immediate value, while specialization could take its own measured path.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## What can Enterprise AI help Business with: The Value Imperative
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

You do this by

1. Connecting enterprise APIs to AI, and indirectly structured data
2. Connecting enterprise unstrctured data to AI
3. Connecting ERP Systems to AI
4. Connecting SharePoint to AI
5. Connecting DevOps to AI
6. Connecting Work flows to AI

Question is one of how quickly and cost effectively can one do it? 

This is done in a two step process, each yielding it value immediately.

1. Implement MCP servers. Just MCP Servers. General purpose UX will take care of value generation.
2. Implement Agents on top of MCP servers

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## The distinct opportunity of MCP Servers
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Among the GenAI development activities, Developing MCP Servers offer a distinct advantage. Far bigger than other activities because of the following

1. They are easy to develop
2. Learning curve is incredibly small
3. There is a clear distinction between UX and MCP Server development making teams independent
4. MCP servers can be plugged into a variety of enabling GenAI UX facilities like chats, agents, MS Teams, Slack etc.
5. One example: A chat program that is enabled for enterprise MCP servers can explore the entire Enterprise data as MCP servers come on board one by one
6. They offer the BEST opportunity to securely make enterprise data available to LLMs almost from day 1

To summarize, the core proposal is to decouple the AI **UX layer** from APIs and data:

1. Enterprises or developers build and maintain MCP‑compliant servers (tool servers, prompt servers, etc.)
2. A set of universal UX platforms (like ChatGPT, Slack, Teams) acts as out of the box front‑ends
3. The UX allows to dynamically exercise both read and write enterprise assets by allowing any command: "Do this"

This design reduces the cost and time to develop new capabilities by scripting through English in general purpose UIs.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## Enterprise Shells: The Role of General‑Purpose UX Layers
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

A **horizontal UX layer** refers to a shared, consistent front‑end that supports any MCP‑compliant backend. This layer can:

1. This can be just a chat program
2. Or Display custom tools or agents regardless of provider
3. Or Orchestrate workflows using agentic AI logic
4. Serve as a consistent UI for data input, output, and task management

**Examples:**

1. **ChatGPT UI** is evolving to support autonomous workflows and record modes, integrating well with agentic capabilities.
2. **CrewAI, Autogen, and Google A2A** are pushing toward similar goals but vary in UX maturity.

This UX layer becomes the “enterprise shell” for GenAI.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## Implications for Enterprise Adoption
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

1. **Reduced friction between teams:** Enterprises no longer need to rebuild or re‑skin AI applications.
2. **Speed:** New tools or capabilities can be added by deploying a new MCP endpoint—no UX work needed.
3. **Trust:** A single UX layer can manage auth, observability, and data policy enforcement.
4. **Modularity:** Agents can be composed from tool calls, prompt libraries, or shared corpuses across teams.
5. **Decentralization:** Teams can simultaneously add capabilities without friction

This structure enables teams to focus on domain logic instead of UI infrastructure.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## MCP  servers are the ground layer for Agentic AI 
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Programming AI agents is really simple. It is done in English!!

However, to execute Agents, they need read/write access to enterprise assets. This is where MCP servers play a fundamentally enabling role. As they are simple to write, and independent of where they are used, an Enterprise has so much more incentive to write MCP servers.

So the key points to Agent enable an Enterprise quickly and cost effectively are:

1. **MCPs** standardize the backend capabilities (tools, inputs, outputs)
2. **Agentic dependency on MCP Servers**: Agentic code is in English. They rely on MCPs to read or manipulate Enterprise assets. MCPs form the back bone of Agents.
3. **UX platforms** handle orchestration, multi‑turn dialogs, tool execution, context memory
4. Like MCP Servers, **Agents** are also exercised by horizontal UX tools

This is a scalable model for deploying large numbers of agents across business domains (finance, HR, ops, marketing).


<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## What do solution architectures look like when seen from the perspective of MCP and Agents?
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Because of the intelligence offered by AI, think first, how to architect solutions that "tell" AI.

1. Think first, can I solve the problem, can I add business value, by simply exposing the underlying APIs and let the prompts do the job, under the desire and supervision of an operator
2. In other words, if I provide appropriate MCP servers to a Chatbot can it solve the problem?
3. How do I enhance the collective by gradually providing enhancements through micro-contributions of MCP servers?
4. Once the horizontal-ux is enabled for Agents, how can I further write "Agents" in English to reach a delightful experience?

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## What tools you need to develop MCP Servers?
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

1. You will use python and the FastMCP SDK to create a MCP servers
2. **You will need a test bed to test MCP Servers**
3. Look for an OpenSource "chat" program that is enabled for registering MCP Servers
4. I used a react tool called "assistant ui" with some code changes. 
5. Look for one, that may be more out of the box than "assistant ui"
6. Also look for one that is integrated into SSO to manage user conext
7. Even better if the tool enables "out of the box" agents like CrewAI, AutoGen, or LangGraph

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## How do you bring value with MCP servers?
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

**Basic need:**

1. Look for a UX that is enabled for MCP Servers
2. Very few enterprises these days that don't have either an on-premise ai-chat or a public ai-chat that is available with in the company
3. if it is an external chatbot like ChatGPT for the Enterprise, see if they are enabled for MCP Servers
4. if the chatbot is an internal one, challenge is to enable it for MCP servers!!
5. For value, MCP enabled chatbots become really important!

**Advanced use**

1. Allow the UX to select MCP servers and tools for specific tasks at hand
2. Allow pre-programmed sharable prompts to accomplish standardized tasks
3. Write Agents through prompts for long running tasks
4. Have registries (easy to create one with SharePoint lists to meet the needs) of MCP Servers
5. Make tool descriptions available for public reads

**What can you expect with just mere MCP Servers**

1. Make most knowledge repositories exposed to chat programs
2. There could be 10s of them (There may be none when you start) that can be exposed in a short time, especially if you automate the semantic indexing of sources like SharePoint
3. Most tools may already come with MCP servers out of the box, like Github, Rally etc.
4. Use (available) MCP servers to **powerfully** work with XLS, Word, PowerPoint etc. Most ai vendors are offering these now out of the box.

**What can you expect with Agents**

1. Standalone agents can be written today with AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph etc, if you have MCP servers written!
2. These can be invoked through schedulers handily
3. Or look for integration with Slack or other Agent enabled chatbots to make them available to business users
4. Use on-premise coding Agents (when they allow this feature) to take advantage of MCP servers to run devops
5. Use Agents or prompts to manage IT ops.

**Chatbots as GenAI Enterprise Shells**

1. In its sublime experience of this model, the chats can start to look like very intelligent command line programs where you are commanding the Agents that are enabled through MCP servers
2. Preprogrammed prompts play a bit role in this model
3. Importance of tested and versioned prompt and Agent libraries will start to become important
4. As always each Agent and tool needs to be auhtorized and secured

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## Negative patterns
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

1. To think of every solution as a vertical application where LLM is only an API
2. To **disperse** energies in siloed verticals when that same effort focused on MCP and Agents would have enabled far greated speed and ROI. A case of wasted energy.
3. Overfitting: Especially in RAG applications to find solutions that are based on similarity serch when APIs or direct text would have been more suitable
4. Over Engineering: To overapply NLP, Data science, or Image processing techniques to be far more accurate than is necessary

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## How should an Enterprise focus its energies in this desired Transformation?
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

1. Redirect investments and energies in Enablement of a faster path
   1. Redirect investment and energies for enabling their chatbots for MCP servers
   2. Redirect investment and energies for enabling their chatbots for Agents
   3. Focus energies to develop MCP Servers and Agents
2. Only then the Expansion.....
   1. Significant Value phase: Solve business problems using these horizontal technologies 
   2. Refinement Value phase: Develop vertical applications from understanding gained from step 5 (A post optimzation step.)
   3. Excel phase: Enhance horizontal UX with built-in-platform-like apps (Vendors will likely offer this soon - A custom ux experience)

**Negative pattern**

To treat and focus on "all values" the same, and spend energies and investments with equal value. This will cripple progress as the "basic roads were not paved, rails were not laid".

You will navigate to vertical apps.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## Micro Soft: How are the AI and Enterprise AI vendors approaching Enterprises?
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

It is instructive to see how some key leaders in this space are seeing the enterprise architecture!

### Basics

1. The Primary UXs are: Copilot chat, office, Teams
2. There are default data sets that are fully exposed to this chat like onedrive, SP etc. Admins control what one can see or not, otherwise it is all
3. When a user chats in the Work context, Copilot quietly grounds on Microsoft Graph (SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Exchange, Teams, etc.) plus any external content your admins have indexed via Copilot/Graph connectors—all filtered by that user’s permissions. There’s no per-chat “pick a connector” UI for end users.
4. Agents get involved when externa content needs to be read or written to

### Agent designs, connectors, MCPs

1. Copilot studio is used to create agents
2. Agents uses many MS internal APIs to write connectors
3. OpenAPI (Swagger) is a key standard
4. uses MCP recently when available
5. MCPs are not directly exposed to chats
6. They go through Agents
7. Once defined and deployed by Copilot studio they are exposed to UXs
8. There is NO SEPARATE UX for agents or MCPs
9. You can only talk to 1 agent. But that can be an orchestrator that talks to other agents
10. Agents can be long running
11. Agents mostly in English
12. Configured Custom UX through MS Teams Message Extensions (Via modal controls for input and custom cards for output)

### Fabric Data Agent

1. A special agent for lakehouse, tables, kql etc on fabric
2. Created in a Fabric workspace, with sources selected from the OneLake catalog
3. Limited to a set of tables and schemas selected
4. Directly answers based on the schema based on structured data
5. NL to SQL kind of a deal

### Bottom line Enterprise architecture

1. Horizontal UXs: Excel, Word, Teams, Chat
2. Prebuilt RAG (Semantic indexing)
3. Extensions through Agents
4. Agents, at moment are heavily influenced by MS native connectors
5. MCPs are exposed through Agents
6. Chat is a bit weak: for example such concepts as Projects, Canvases, etc.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
## Strategic Advantages of the MCP + UX Architecture
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

* **Cost‑effective deployment:** One or few UX platform for hundreds of MCP Servers and agents.
* **Enterprise readiness:** Compliance, security, and governance embedded at the UX layer.
* **Ecosystem growth:** Tool builders focus on MCP endpoints; UX builders on interactivity.
* **Future‑proofing:** Enterprises can adopt new backends (Claude, GPT, Gemini) without UI changes.

Like never before, MCP offers a rare opportunity for speed and cost.
