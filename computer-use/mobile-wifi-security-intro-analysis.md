# Do's and Don'ts (Summary)
<!-- ********************* -->

**Do:**

* Use password-protected Wi-Fi when available.
* Check the exact Wi-Fi name with staff before connecting.
* Make sure your phone and apps are updated.
* Disconnect from public Wi-Fi when not in use.

**Don't:**

* Don‚Äôt trust open networks with no password.
* Don‚Äôt enter sensitive data (e.g., bank logins) unless you're sure the app or site uses HTTPS.
* Don‚Äôt click on strange pop-ups or install apps prompted by the network.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Is Xfinity Wi-Fi Secure?
<!-- ********************* -->

Xfinity offers two kinds of public Wi-Fi:

* **xfinitywifi** ‚Äì Open and less secure.
* **XFINITY** ‚Äì Uses WPA2-Enterprise and is more secure.

The "XFINITY" network is safer because it uses encryption. Still, avoid using either for banking unless your app uses HTTPS and your device is trusted.

<!-- ********************* -->
# What is Hotspot 2.0?
<!-- ********************* -->

Hotspot 2.0 (also known as Passpoint) is a secure Wi-Fi standard that allows your phone to connect automatically to participating Wi-Fi networks using stored credentials. It improves security and convenience, especially with large providers like Xfinity or AT\&T.

<!-- ********************* -->
# How to Enable or Disable Hotspot 2.0 on Android/Samsung
<!-- ********************* -->

1. Go to **Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi**.
2. Tap the **three dots** in the upper-right corner.
3. Choose **Advanced**.
4. Find **Hotspot 2.0** or **Auto-connect to Xfinity WiFi** and toggle it.
5. To stop connecting to these networks entirely, tap on them and choose **Forget**.

<!-- ********************* -->
# How to Check What Wi-Fi Network You're Connected To
<!-- ********************* -->

1. Swipe down and tap the Wi-Fi icon.
2. Long-press it to open Wi-Fi settings.
3. The connected network will say **"Connected"**.
4. Tap the network to view details like speed and security.

<!-- ********************* -->
# How to Manually Connect or Disconnect from Wi-Fi on Android
<!-- ********************* -->

**To Connect:**

* Open **Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi**.
* Tap the desired network.
* Enter the password if prompted.

**To Disconnect:**

* Tap the connected network.
* Choose **Disconnect** or **Forget** to stop auto-reconnection.

<!-- ********************* -->
# When Should You Connect to Public Networks?
<!-- ********************* -->

* Use public Wi-Fi if no mobile data is available and the connection is password-protected.
* Avoid open networks unless absolutely necessary.
* For apps like banking that use HTTPS, risk is moderate to low if the app is trusted and your device is secure.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Are There Secure Ways to Use Public Wi-Fi?
<!-- ********************* -->

Yes:

* Prefer networks that require a password (look for the lock icon).
* Confirm network name with staff.
* Use apps that are updated and known to use HTTPS.
* Disconnect when finished.

<!-- ********************* -->
# How to Set Android to Connect Only to Chosen Networks
<!-- ********************* -->

1. Go to **Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi**.
2. Tap the **three dots > Advanced**.
3. Turn off **Auto-connect to open networks**.
4. Forget any networks you don‚Äôt recognize or trust.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Xfinity Hotspot vs Cafe Wi-Fi: Which is Safer?
<!-- ********************* -->

* **Xfinity "XFINITY"** hotspot: safer due to encryption, but only in trusted areas.
* **Cafe Wi-Fi**: safer if password-protected and verified with staff.

If both are password-protected, either is acceptable for general use. Use your mobile network or a VPN for banking or private activity.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Pros, Cons, and Pitfalls of Internet Use in Cafes
<!-- ********************* -->

**Pros:**

* Convenient and usually free.
* Suitable for browsing and apps with HTTPS.

**Cons:**

* Shared access means other people are on the same network.
* Some routers don‚Äôt block communication between users.

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**

* Using open Wi-Fi without password.
* Leaving Wi-Fi on to auto-connect to unknown networks.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Security Expectations and Cautions for Cafe Wi-Fi Use
<!-- ********************* -->

### What Is Typically Secure in a Caf√©

* Most caf√©s use WPA2-protected Wi-Fi with a shared password.
* Most banking and email apps use HTTPS, which encrypts your data.

### Remaining Risks

* Others may be on the same network and see some traffic.
* If someone sets up a fake Wi-Fi network with the same name, your phone might connect.
* Device compromise is always a risk if you're not up to date.

### Smart Habits

* Don‚Äôt install apps or click pop-ups while on public Wi-Fi.
* Use your mobile data when doing private tasks.
* Confirm Wi-Fi names with staff.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Super Novice User Tips and Risk Levels
<!-- ********************* -->

### ‚úÖ Easy Do‚Äôs:

* Ask staff for the network name.
* Look for the lock icon next to the Wi-Fi name.
* Use known apps like banking or email without logging into a browser.
* Reconnect only to networks you trust.

### ‚ùå Easy Don'ts:

* Don‚Äôt use open Wi-Fi (no password).
* Don‚Äôt enter credit card info or login details unless the app is familiar.
* Don‚Äôt accept system prompts you weren‚Äôt expecting.

### üü° Risk Levels for Common Use:

| Action                              | Risk Level                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reading news, weather, or maps      | Low                                                         |
| Using banking apps (with HTTPS)     | Low to Moderate (acceptable if app is updated and official) |
| Logging in through a web browser    | Higher                                                      |
| Installing apps or updates on Wi-Fi | Higher                                                      |

You don‚Äôt need to understand all the tech. Just follow these habits, and you‚Äôll stay safe in most common caf√© situations.

<!-- ********************* -->
# Why HTTPS May Still Carry Risk on Public Wi-Fi
<!-- ********************* -->

HTTPS (padlock in the URL) encrypts your communication between the app or browser and the website. But that doesn‚Äôt make you 100% safe:

### Risks Even with HTTPS:

* **Fake Wi-Fi networks (evil twins)**: If your phone connects to a malicious network pretending to be the caf√© Wi-Fi, it may intercept or manipulate your traffic.
* **Outdated apps or browsers**: If your app or browser has known vulnerabilities, attackers might still exploit them even over HTTPS.
* **Certificate tricks**: Some attackers attempt to use fraudulent or manipulated certificates to impersonate real websites.
* **Device-level threats**: If malware is present on your phone, it can capture your screen or data before it ever leaves your device ‚Äî regardless of HTTPS.

### Bottom Line:

HTTPS is a huge layer of protection, but not a guarantee. When on public Wi-Fi:

* Stick to trusted apps (e.g., official banking app).
* Avoid logging into new websites through a browser.
* Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files.
