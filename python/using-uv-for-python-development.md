# How to use UV to manage Python environments

## 1. Introduction

`uv` is a high-performance, Rust-based package manager for Python that simplifies dependency management without the need for virtual environments (`venv`). It provides fast installs, native lockfile support, and modern isolation similar to `npm` or `pnpm` in the JavaScript world. This guide explains how to use `uv` as the primary tool for managing Python environments and integrating it with VS Code.

## 2. Installing `uv`

### 2.1 Windows

```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
```

### 2.2 macOS/Linux

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Verify installation:

```bash
uv --version
```

## 3. Setting Up a Project Without `venv`

### 3.1 Project Initialization

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
uv init
uv pip install <library-name>
```

This creates a `pyproject.toml`, resolves the dependency, and stores everything in a global cache with per-project metadata in `.uv/`.

### 3.2 How Does `uv` Know Where the Environment Is?

`uv` detects the root of a project by looking for a `pyproject.toml` file or `.uv/` directory. Always run `uv run` from within the project root or its subdirectories.

### 3.3 Where Are Packages Stored?

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\uv\packages`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.cache/uv/packages`

### 3.4 Useful Commands

List installed dependencies:

```bash
uv pip freeze
```

Run a Python script:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

## 4. Using VS Code with `uv`

With `uv`, integrating VS Code requires a few specific settings so that `uv` runs correctly inside VS Code terminals, run commands, and debuggers.

### 4.1 Purpose of Configuring `uv` in VS Code

By default, VS Code expects a Python interpreter path ‚Äî either from the system or a `venv`. Since `uv` wraps Python execution dynamically, you instruct VS Code to run Python via `uv run python` to ensure the correct project environment is picked up automatically.

### 4.2 Configuring VS Code Settings

Create or update `.vscode/settings.json` in your project folder:

```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "uv run python",
    "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false
}
```

This tells VS Code to:

- Run Python using `uv run python`
- Skip trying to activate any `venv` (since `uv` handles isolation)

### 4.3 Running Python Scripts in VS Code

Now, when you right-click any `.py` file and select "Run Python File in Terminal," or use the `Run` button in the editor, VS Code will run:

```bash
uv run python <your-script>.py
```

### 4.4 Configuring Debugging with `uv`

For debugging support with `uv`, configure `.vscode/launch.json` as below:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python Debug with uv",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "justMyCode": true,
            "python": "uv run python"
        }
    ]
}
```

Now you can:

- Run Python files normally
- Debug Python files using F5
- Avoid managing or activating any `venv`

VS Code and `uv` together provide a modern, frictionless Python development experience.

## 5. Comparing `uv` vs `venv`

## 6. Nuances of Running Scripts with `uv`

Understanding how `uv` locates and manages project environments when running Python scripts is essential for a smooth workflow.

### 6.1 Running from the Project Root

If you are in the root directory of your project (where `pyproject.toml` exists), simply run:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

This works seamlessly because `uv` finds the environment definition right there.

### 6.2 Running from a Subdirectory within the Project

If your working directory is a subfolder inside your project:

```bash
cd myproject/subfolder
uv run python ../script.py
```

`uv` will search parent directories until it finds the nearest `pyproject.toml` and `.uv/` and will use that environment.

### 6.3 Running from Outside the Project

If you are in a completely different location:

```bash
cd ~
uv run python ~/myproject/script.py
```

- `uv` will start from the location of the script (`~/myproject/script.py`) and search upwards for `pyproject.toml`.
- If found, it will use that environment.
- If not found, it will default to the global context or error out.

### Best Practice

Although `uv` can resolve the environment from the script path, it is still good practice to `cd` into the project root or a subdirectory of the project before running scripts to avoid ambiguity and ensure clarity in larger, multi-project setups.

## 7. The Conceptual View of Using `uv`

`uv` changes the traditional way of thinking about Python development and environment management. Rather than explicitly creating, activating, and managing virtual environments, `uv` encourages thinking at the level of a project boundary.

Each project folder becomes a self-contained universe defined by:

- Its `pyproject.toml` file (declaring what you care about)
- Its `uv.lock` file (capturing what is actually used)
- Its `.uv/` directory (internal bookkeeping for `uv`)

This is similar to the experience in other ecosystems like Node.js with `npm` or `pnpm`, where the presence of a `package.json` defines a project boundary.

### Mental Model for a Python Developer using `uv`

```text
- Is this script part of a uv project? ‚Üí Just run it with uv
- What dependencies does this project need? ‚Üí Declare them in pyproject.toml
- Do I need to activate environments manually? ‚Üí No, uv resolves and runs in project context
```

This makes day-to-day workflows simpler, faster, and more reproducible. Developers can focus on writing Python code without worrying about environment setup intricacies.

Run any script like:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

Run any script like:

```bash
uv run python script.py
```

## 8. How `uv` Handles Direct vs Transitive Dependencies

When you install a package using `uv pip install <library-name>`, `uv` manages dependencies at two levels:

1. Direct Dependencies ‚Äî explicitly installed by you.
2. Transitive (Indirect) Dependencies ‚Äî automatically installed because they are required by your direct dependencies.

### How Does It Work?

- Only the direct dependencies you install go into `pyproject.toml`.
- All transitive dependencies are captured and locked in the `uv.lock` file.

This separation keeps `pyproject.toml` clean and human-friendly, while ensuring reproducibility via the lockfile.

### What is Locking?

Locking refers to capturing the exact versions of all dependencies ‚Äî both direct and transitive ‚Äî that `uv` resolved at install time. This is written into `uv.lock`.

This ensures:

- The same environment on all developer machines.
- Reproducible builds in CI/CD.
- No surprises from upstream dependency changes.

Whenever you:

- Install a new package ‚Üí `uv.lock` is automatically updated.
- Remove a package ‚Üí `uv.lock` is automatically updated.
- Manually edit `pyproject.toml` ‚Üí Run `uv pip compile` to update `uv.lock`.

### File Responsibilities

| File             | Contains                                               | Managed by                      |   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | - |
| `pyproject.toml` | Direct dependencies only                               | `uv pip install`                |   |
| `uv.lock`        | Direct + all transitive dependencies (locked versions) | Auto-update or `uv pip compile` |   |

## 8. About `pyproject.toml` and Understanding Dependencies

The `pyproject.toml` file is the heart of every Python project managed by `uv`. It defines your project‚Äôs metadata and explicitly lists the top-level (direct) dependencies that you care about.

Unlike `requirements.txt`, which can be large and messy listing every single installed package, `pyproject.toml` stays clean and focused on just the libraries you directly installed.

When you run:

```bash
uv pip install <library-name>
```

`uv` adds that package to `pyproject.toml` under `[project.dependencies]`.

### Why is this Powerful?

- Clean project definition
- Easy to review & audit
- Version control-friendly

The full dependency tree (including all transitive dependencies required by your libraries) is automatically captured in the `uv.lock` file.

This provides:

- Guaranteed reproducibility
- Predictable environments across all machines
- Confidence that your app won't suddenly break because an indirect dependency changed upstream

Example `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Example Python project using uv"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[project.dependencies]
requests = "*"
numpy = "*"
flask = "*"
```

## 9. Managing Dependencies

Install:

```bash
uv pip install <library-name>
```

Remove:

```bash
uv pip uninstall <library-name>
```

Manual edit requires locking:

```bash
uv pip compile
```

### Example `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Example Python project using uv"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[project.dependencies]
requests = "*"
numpy = "*"
flask = "*"
```
