# Background
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

I wanted to install the recently released OpenAI CLI and test its capabilities and see where it can be used.

I wanted to use it as a tool and not a python package SDK that which it is.

I wanted a global install where I can just invoke it on the command line and not worry about a specific python project and using a venv like environment.

This article describes how to install the OpenAI CLI tool using the newer python package manager "uv".

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# How Tools differ from Python SDKs
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Python **SDKs (Software Development Kits)** and **Tools** serve different purposes, even though both may come from the same package source.

A **Python SDK** is designed for use *inside Python code*. It provides classes, methods, and APIs that developers import into scripts or applications. For example, the OpenAI SDK allows developers to write code like:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-5", messages=[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}])
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

SDKs integrate directly into Python programs and typically rely on the project’s virtual environment to manage dependencies.

By contrast, a **Tool**—like the OpenAI CLI—is a **standalone command-line application**. It’s used from a terminal or shell without needing to write Python code. Tools provide immediate, scriptable functionality that can be used globally across the system. For instance:

```bash
openai api chat_completions.create -m gpt-5 -g '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

In this case, you’re invoking the OpenAI service directly via command-line commands, not by importing a library.

In summary:

* **SDKs** are for developers integrating APIs within Python code.
* **Tools** are for users invoking functionality at the command line.
* Tools may be *built on top* of SDKs internally but provide a higher-level, user-facing interface that doesn’t require coding.

# What is uv
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

`uv` is a **fast, next‑generation Python package manager** and environment manager created by Astral (the team behind Ruff). It aims to unify dependency resolution, virtual environments, and tool installs with extreme speed and simplicity.

`uv` can:

* Replace `pip`, `pipx`, and even `venv` for many workflows.
* Manage global CLI tools and project dependencies.
* Work across multiple Python versions with caching and sandboxing.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Why use uv for tool installs
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

`uv` includes a **built‑in tool management system** (`uv tool`) similar to pipx but faster and more integrated.

Benefits:

* Blazing‑fast installs (Rust‑based resolver and caching).
* Unified workflow for projects and global tools.
* Automatically isolates each tool in its own environment.
* Cross‑platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* Works even if pipx is not installed.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Installing uv
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

You can install **uv** either via its official install script or directly through Python. The script method is the most common, but the Python-based method can be simpler if Python is already available.

### Option 1 – Official installer (recommended)

**Explanation:**
This PowerShell command uses `irm` (Invoke-RestMethod) to download the install script from Astral’s website (`https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1`) and pipes it to `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which executes the downloaded script immediately. In simpler terms, it fetches and runs the official PowerShell installer for uv in one step. While convenient, this approach should only be used for trusted sources because it downloads and executes remote code directly.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Option 2 – Install via Python

If you already have Python and pip installed, you can install uv directly:

```bash
python -m pip install uv
```

This will install the `uv` executable into your environment or global site-packages directory, making it accessible like any other Python CLI.

### Verify installation

```bash
uv --version
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Verify installation:

```bash
uv --version
```

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Installing CLI tools with uv
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

### Install a tool globally

```bash
uv tool install openai
```

### Run a tool directly without installing

```bash
uvx openai --version
```

(`uvx` is uv’s equivalent of `pipx run`, executing tools in a temporary environment.)

### Specify a Python version for the tool

```bash
uv tool install --python 3.12 openai
```

### Reinstall or upgrade

```bash
uv tool upgrade openai
uv tool upgrade-all
```

### Uninstall a tool

```bash
uv tool uninstall openai
```

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Managing tools
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

### List all installed tools

```bash
uv tool list
```

### Show environment details for a tool

```bash
uv tool info openai
```

### Clean caches

```bash
uv cache clean
```

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# How uv stores tools
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

`uv` creates an isolated environment per tool under its own managed directory (for example, `~/.cache/uv/tools/`). The executables are symlinked into a bin directory that’s added to your PATH automatically by the installer.

To confirm location:

```bash
uv tool info openai
```

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# How uv Chooses Python When Inside a venv
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

When you run `uv tool install` inside a repository that already has an active virtual environment, uv does **not** automatically use that venv’s Python. Instead, it selects Python according to the following rules:

1. **Explicit ********************************************************`--python`******************************************************** flag** — If you specify a version or path using `--python`, uv uses that interpreter.

   ```bash
   uv tool install --python 3.12 openai
   ```

2. **Environment variable or configuration** — If your `UV_PYTHON` environment variable or `uv.toml` configuration file defines a preferred Python, uv uses that.

3. **Default system interpreter** — If neither of the above is set, uv uses the default system Python it was installed with (usually the one on your PATH during installation).

In short, `uv tool` is independent of a project’s venv. It’s designed to manage **global tools** rather than project‑specific dependencies. For repo‑local management, use `uv add` and `uv sync` instead.

---

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Best practices
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

* Use `uv tool install` for global CLI tools that you want available system‑wide.
* Use `uv add` / `uv sync` for project‑level dependencies inside repos.
* Prefer `uvx` when testing a tool temporarily without global installation.
* Use `uv tool upgrade-all` periodically to stay current.
* Avoid managing the same tool with both pipx and uv to prevent PATH conflicts.
