# Quick note
<!-- ************************************************************ -->
You may want to use "uv" instead of pipx as a modern alternative to most python tools.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Background of Python Tools vs Python libraries
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Python distinguishes between **libraries** and **tools**. A library is a collection of modules and functions designed to be imported into Python code, such as `requests`, `pandas`, or `openai`. You typically install these libraries inside a project-specific virtual environment and use them programmatically.

By contrast, a **tool** is a Python-based command-line application intended to be run directly from a terminal, like `black`, `httpie`, `poetry`, or the OpenAI CLI. These tools are often built on top of libraries but expose a user interface rather than a programming API.

In practice:

* Libraries are installed into project environments and imported in code.
* Tools are installed globally (via `pipx` or `uv`) and executed from the command line.

Understanding this difference helps determine whether to install something inside a venv for a project or globally for system-wide use.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# What is pipx
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

`pipx` is a Python application installer for **CLI tools**. It installs each tool into its **own isolated virtual environment** and exposes the tool’s executable on your system `PATH`. This keeps global Python clean and avoids per‑project reinstallation when you only need a command‑line app.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# When to use pipx vs pip/venv
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Use **pipx** for installing **command‑line applications** such as `openai`, `black`, `flake8`, `httpie`, `poetry`, or `uvicorn`.

Use **pip inside a project venv** for **libraries you import in code**, such as `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, or the OpenAI SDK when your Python files do `from openai import OpenAI`.

Guideline: CLI tool → `pipx`. Project dependency → `pip` in a project‑specific `venv`.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Install pipx (Windows / macOS / Linux)
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

When installing pipx, you might see two common forms:

### 1. `python -m pip install --user pipx`

This is the **recommended** method. It ensures the pip module used belongs to the same Python interpreter you’re running. It also avoids permission problems and confusion if multiple Python versions are installed.

### 2. `pip install pipx`

This works in many cases, but it can sometimes call a different pip linked to another Python installation or require admin privileges.

Using the full form `python -m pip install --user pipx` guarantees pipx is installed correctly under your chosen Python.

---

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python -m pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

**macOS / Linux (with pip):**

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

**macOS (Homebrew alternative):**

```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

After installation, **open a new terminal** so the updated PATH is recognized.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Make the `pipx` path available
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

`pipx ensurepath` prints the directories that should be on your `PATH`. Open a new shell afterward. To confirm:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
pipx --version
Get-Command openai
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
pipx --version
command -v openai
```

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Core usage: install, run, list, upgrade, uninstall
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

### Install a CLI tool

```bash
pipx install openai
```

### Run a tool once without installing (temporary venv)

```bash
pipx run openai --version
```

### List all pipx‑managed apps

```bash
pipx list
```

### Upgrade one app or all apps

```bash
pipx upgrade openai
pipx upgrade-all
```

### Uninstall

```bash
pipx uninstall openai
```

### Inject an extra library into a tool’s venv (advanced)

```bash
pipx inject openai some-extra-package
```

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Where pipx stores apps
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

`pipx` creates a dedicated virtual environment per app, typically under a user directory (for example, `~/.local/pipx/venvs/<app>` on macOS/Linux, and a corresponding user data directory on Windows). The **executables** are symlinked or copied into a user‑level bin directory that is added to `PATH` by `pipx ensurepath`.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Tips and best practices
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

* Use **pipx for CLIs** you want available across projects (e.g., `openai`).
* Keep **project code isolated** in per‑project `venv`s; install libraries there with `pip`.
* Prefer `pipx upgrade-all` periodically to keep tools current.
* If a tool needs plugins, use `pipx inject` to keep them within that tool’s venv.
* For reproducible dev setups, document global CLIs in a onboarding script or README.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# pipx and uv: how they interact
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

**Short version:** `pipx` and `uv` are complementary but separate. Use **one** of them to manage global CLI tools; they don’t directly integrate.

### Options

1. **Use pipx to manage tools (default path).**

   * Install a CLI globally but isolated:

     ```bash
     pipx install openai
     ```
   * Upgrades/removals stay within pipx; installs use `pip` under the hood and benefit from the shared pip cache.

2. **Use uv’s built‑in tool manager (pipx alternative).**

   * `uv` can install CLI apps globally in isolated environments (similar to pipx):

     ```bash
     uv tool install openai
     uv tool list
     uv tool upgrade openai
     uv tool uninstall openai
     ```
   * This keeps everything under `uv`’s ultra‑fast resolver and cache.

3. **Use pipx with a Python interpreter managed by uv.**

   * If `uv` installed a specific Python (e.g., 3.12), point pipx at that interpreter when creating tool envs:

     ```bash
     pipx install --python <path-to-uv-managed-python> openai
     ```
   * pipx will still use `pip` inside its envs, but tools will run on the uv‑managed Python runtime you chose.

### What you generally should NOT do

* Try to make pipx call `uv pip` internally — pipx is designed to use `pip` inside its own venvs.
* Manage the **same** tool with both pipx and uv at once (choose one to avoid PATH confusion).

### Practical guidance

* If you already use **pipx** comfortably, keep using it for global CLIs; it’s battle‑tested and simple.
* If you want **maximum speed** and prefer an all‑in‑one workflow, consider **uv’s tool manager** instead of pipx.
* For **projects**, you can still use `uv` for lightning‑fast installs inside venvs, independent of how you manage global CLIs.

- Use **pipx for CLIs** you want available across projects (e.g., `openai`).
- Keep **project code isolated** in per‑project `venv`s; install libraries there with `pip`.
- Prefer `pipx upgrade-all` periodically to keep tools current.
- If a tool needs plugins, use `pipx inject` to keep them within that tool’s venv.
- For reproducible dev setups, document global CLIs in a onboarding script or README.

# How Multiple Python Installations Affect pipx
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

If you have multiple versions of Python installed (for example, Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.12), the version you use when running `python -m pip install --user pipx` determines which interpreter pipx is tied to.

* When you run `python -m pip install`, the command uses the **specific Python interpreter** that `python` points to. On Windows, you can also explicitly choose one:

  ```powershell
  py -3.12 -m pip install --user pipx
  ```

  This installs pipx using Python 3.12.

* On macOS or Linux, you might specify:

  ```bash
  python3.11 -m pip install --user pipx
  ```

  to bind pipx to Python 3.11.

* The `pipx` tool itself manages its own virtual environments and can use the same or a different interpreter for installing apps. You can control this with:

  ```bash
  pipx install --python python3.12 openai
  ```

  to force pipx to use a particular Python version when creating the tool’s venv.

This flexibility ensures that if you have multiple Pythons, you always know which one `pipx` and its managed tools depend on.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# What Happens if You Switch Python Versions
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

If you install pipx using one Python interpreter but later activate a shell or environment where a different Python is the default, the `pipx` command still works independently of that new environment.

Here’s why:

* `pipx` is installed as a standalone script in your user’s PATH, pointing to the Python interpreter that created it.
* When you run `pipx`, it uses the same interpreter it was installed with — not whichever Python happens to be active in your shell.
* Even if another Python is the current default, pipx keeps functioning normally because it lives in its own isolated venv under `~/.local/pipx` (or your user’s AppData equivalent on Windows).

If you want to confirm which interpreter pipx uses:

```bash
pipx environment
```

Or inspect directly:

```bash
where pipx   # Windows
which pipx   # macOS/Linux
```

You can also reinstall pipx with a different Python if you’d like it to track that version instead.

---

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# How pipx Handles Python for Installed Tools
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Once pipx is installed, every `pipx install` command by default uses the **same Python interpreter** that pipx itself was installed with—unless you explicitly specify another using `--python`.

That means:

* A subsequent `pipx install openai` (or any other tool) will continue to use pipx’s origin Python version to create and run the tool’s isolated venv.
* It doesn’t matter which Python environment is currently active in your shell; pipx uses its own configured interpreter.
* If you want to change that default, reinstall pipx with a different Python or use:

  ```bash
  pipx install --python python3.12 <package>
  ```

This design ensures that tool behavior is consistent and independent of temporary environment changes.

---

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Multiple pipx Installations and Python Versions
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

It’s possible to have **multiple pipx installations**, each tied to a different Python interpreter. This can happen if you run `python3.10 -m pip install --user pipx` and later `python3.12 -m pip install --user pipx`.

Each Python version will create its own pipx executable and configuration under that interpreter’s user directory.

### What This Means

* Each pipx instance manages its own isolated set of tool environments.
* When you type `pipx` in a terminal, the first one found in your PATH is used.
* Therefore, your system might have several pipx executables, but only one will be active at a time depending on PATH order.
* You can check which one is currently active:

  ```bash
  where pipx   # Windows
  which pipx   # macOS/Linux
  ```

### Managing Multiple pipx Versions

* You can **uninstall one** by running the uninstall command from the specific Python interpreter:

  ```bash
  python3.10 -m pip uninstall pipx
  ```
* Or reinstall pipx with a specific Python version you want as default:

  ```bash
  py -3.12 -m pip install --user pipx
  ```
* Avoid mixing too many pipx versions; it’s best to keep one primary pipx installation managing all your tools.

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# pipx and Virtual Environments
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

Even if you activate a project-specific virtual environment, running a previously installed `pipx` command still uses the original Python interpreter that pipx was tied to, not the venv’s interpreter.

This is because `pipx` operates as a globally installed utility with its own internal environments. The venv does not override or redirect pipx’s interpreter.

If you need a pipx tied to a different interpreter, reinstall pipx with that version of Python or specify `--python` when installing tools through pipx.

---

<!-- ************************************************************ -->
# Troubleshooting
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

* **`pipx: command not found` or **`openai`**** not found**: Run `pipx ensurepath`, then open a new terminal. Confirm with `pipx --version`.
* **Multiple Python versions**: Ensure `python`/`python3` points to the interpreter you intend to use. You can explicitly run `py -m pipx` on Windows.
* **Permissions issues**: Avoid `sudo` on macOS/Linux; install with `--user` and ensure your user bin directory is on `PATH`.
* **Wrong executable used**: On Windows, check with `Get-Command openai` to see the resolved path.
